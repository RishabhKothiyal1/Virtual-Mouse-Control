# Virtual-Mouse-Control
An experimental Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) application built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. Unlike standard gesture controllers, this app features a dual-display interface: a live webcam diagnostic feed and a dedicated, high-performance "Virtual Mouse" window that renders an animated multi-cursor visual.
